    <p>
        Grungle is a card / dice game. blah blah blah. Figure it out.
        Requires a bit of strategy and a pot of luck.
        Pick up cards from the deck and place them on the board.
        Use the dice to change values of the cards.
        Match the suits with the values.
        Get rid of the deck to win.
        Don't fill up the board too fast.
        Use your doubles wisely.
